->Aim : Study of Dictionaries

**Theory**:

- A dictionary is a mutable and unordered data structure that stores data in key : value pairs using {}.

- Values are accessed through unique keys, enabling fast and efficient data retrieval.

- Duplicate keys are not allowed — if a key is repeated, the latest value replaces the old one.

- Dictionaries support easy modification, allowing you to update existing values or add new key–value pairs dynamically.
