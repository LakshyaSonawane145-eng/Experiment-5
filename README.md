->Aim : Study of Dictionaries

**Theory**:
- A dictionary is a mutable and unordered data structure that stores data in key : value pairs.

- Dictionaries are created using curly braces {}.

- Values are retrieved using unique keys, allowing fast and efficient access.

- Duplicate keys are not allowed; the latest value assigned to a key overwrites the previous one.

- The len() function is used to find the number of key–value pairs in a dictionary.

- Dictionaries allow adding new keys, updating existing values, and removing elements using built-in methods.

- Dictionaries are commonly used to store structured and real-world data in Python.

  **Algorithm**:
- Start
- Create dictionaries using {}
- Handle duplicate keys (latest value retained automatically)
- Update values using dictionary[key] = value
- Retrieve values safely using dictionary.get(key, default)
- Accept user input using input()
- Validate login using if dictionary.get(key) == value
- Find the highest value using max(dictionary, key=dictionary.get)
- Display results using print()
- Stop

**Conclusion**:
Python dictionaries provide an efficient way to store and manage data using unique key–value pairs. 
The integrated algorithm highlights how dictionary operations like updating, safe retrieval, searching, and analysis can be easily performed using built-in commands, making dictionaries powerful and practical for real-world applications
